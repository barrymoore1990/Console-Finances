# Console-Finances

## Description

This project was created to analyse the profit and loss of a business by month, to help track the businesses performance. It can be used to help the business improve it's performance by making decisions based on the information produced.

I learned a huge amount, including .map .reduce, improved my knowledge of for loops, how to do max and min and more.

Used documentation from a couple of websites where I wasn't sure how to solve a problem. These include:

I also saw previously answered questions on Stack Overflow which helped point me in the right direction.
